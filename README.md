# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python. The game is played against the computer.

## How to Run

You can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

## Game Rules

1. At the start of the game, the user is asked to input their choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects its choice.
3. The game compares the user's choice and the computer's choice according to the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
4. The game continues until the user decides to stop playing. The game keeps track of the number of times the user and the computer win.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements could include adding a graphical user interface, implementing a score limit to automatically end the game, and adding more game options like Lizard and Spock.
