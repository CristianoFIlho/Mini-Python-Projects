 # Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game written in Python. The game asks the user a series of questions and keeps track of their score.

## How to Run

You can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python quiz_game.py
```

## Game Rules

1. The game starts by asking the user if they want to play. If the user types anything other than "yes", the game will end.
2. If the user agrees to play, the game will ask a series of questions. The user's responses are not case-sensitive.
3. For each correct answer, the user's score is incremented by 1.
4. The game currently includes questions about the abbreviations of computer components, such as CPU and RAM.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements could include adding more questions, implementing a high score feature, and adding a user interface.
