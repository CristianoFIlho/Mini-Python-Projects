GitHub Copilot: # Choose Your Own Adventure Game

This is a simple implementation of a text-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" game in Python. The game presents the user with a series of choices and the game's story changes based on the user's decisions.

## How to Run

You can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python choose_your_own_adventure.py
```

## Game Rules

1. At the start of the game, the user is asked to input their name.
2. The user is then presented with a series of choices, such as which path to take or how to overcome an obstacle.
3. The user's choices determine the outcome of the game. There are multiple endings, some of which result in the user winning and others in which the user loses.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements could include adding more choices and outcomes, implementing a graphical user interface, and adding a save and load feature.
