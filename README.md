 # Number Guesser

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The game generates a random number and the user has to guess it.

## How to Run

You can run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python number_guesser.py
```

## Game Rules

1. At the start of the game, the user is asked to input a number. This number sets the upper limit for the random number that will be generated.
2. If the user inputs anything other than a positive number, the game will end.
3. The user is then asked to guess the generated random number.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number. The game keeps track of the number of guesses made.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements could include adding a high score feature, implementing a user interface, and adding difficulty levels.
